# calculator

This is the calculator assignment from The Odin Project. My goal here is to create a working calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

It will contain:

- Add, Subtract, Multiply, and Divide Functions
- An HTML Interface that allows for user input
- Allow for use of several operations at once
- Rounds answers with long decimals
- A clear function to wipe any existing data
- A backspace button to undo user input
- Keyboard support
- Attractive styling of the visual interface
